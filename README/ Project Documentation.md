   The moive recommender is an simple but powerful application that recommends similar movies based on moive description similarity between users' favourite moive and recommended ones. The application incorproates over 8,800 movie from Netflix and specifically, it requests the user to select one movie as their favourite from those 8,800 ones and then it will recommend the top 5 similar movies based on description similarity. In addition to similar movie recommendation, it offers quick look up of basic movie information including type, director, cast, country, release year, rating, duration, and description.
